# Genetic Algorithm - Smart Dots Game

## Description
The "Smart Dots" project is an implementation of a genetic algorithm in a game environment. The game simulates a population of dots that move to reach a specified target point.

## Repository Contents

### Classes

- **Dot.java**: Class representing a dot in the game, containing logic for movement, fitness evaluation, and mutation.
- **Brain.java**: Implementation of the dot's brain, which generates sets of movements.
- **GameFrame.java**: Class creating the game frame.
- **GamePanel1.java**: Class for the game panel.
- **LaunchPage.java**: Class for the game's start page, where the user can set parameters.
- **Main.java**: Entry point to the program.
- **Population.java**: Class representing the population of dots in the game.

### Helper Classes

- **PVector.java**: Simple implementation of a three-dimensional vector.

## Running the Game
To run the game, compile all the classes and run the Main.java class. In the start interface, you can set the game parameters and then click the "START" button to begin the gameplay.

## Authors
This project was created by Micha≈Ç Ducher.

## Notes
- The project uses the Java programming language and the Java Swing library for the user interface.
- It serves as an example implementation of a genetic algorithm in the context of a simulation game.
